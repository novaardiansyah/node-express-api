# Node Express API

Hi future, welcome to my little project, this time I created a simple REST API template using MongoDB, Express, and Nodejs, the purpose of this project is to make it easier for me to create simple APIs, and also to make it easier for friends who want to learn to make a simple API.

I tried to make Javascript the main language for making this API, and I also tried to make it as simple as possible, so friends who want to learn how to make a simple API can learn it from here.

### How to Use

1. Clone this repository
2. Install all dependencies
3. Run `npm start` to start the server
4. Set your PORT and MONGODB_URI in .env file
5. Run `npm run start` to start the server in development mode
6. Go to `http://localhost:PORT` to see the API documentation
7. You can test the API using Postman, please refer to the documentation in example.http file.

Enjoy!
